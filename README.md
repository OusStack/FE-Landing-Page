### FE - Landing page project

This project builds a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Multi-section landing page

Dynamically add content to the page. This project builds dynamic navigation menu.

When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.

While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top is distinguished from the other sections.
